# git tag
Tags are used to refer to specific points in your git history.

## Usage
```bash 
git tag <name>
```

## When you should use it
I've seen people say they use this in a professional environment where they would tag the repo when they finished a feature in a product.
#### For example
```bash 
git tag v1.0
```
They are also useful when you want to go back to a specific point in git history using `revert`, which we will go into detail.
